Hello fellow Linux Users, this is my first github project and first Linux Project i finished.
It is a journey filled with joy and so i wanted to release my plasma style after about 30h learning, trying and improving. 
For anyone who wants to commit changes i'll check the commit as fast as possible and if i like it, then i'll add it.

Btw, you have to put the theme at /home/user/.local/share/desktoptheme <------Installation
and then you'll have to activate it in the Plasma Settings Panel.

Thanks to the other Linuxers,
have a great day/night.



Based on following Plasma Styles:              
Sweet KDE, Afterglow and
Relax

also try them ;)
